				<h3><strong>OUR PURPOSE</strong></h3>
				<p>Scientists say Earth has about 7.5 sextillion sand grains that have been shaping our coastlines and ocean life for millions of years. Yet, human activity casts a dark shadow. Over 80% of marine pollution originates from land, carried to the sea by rivers and streams. Each year, tons of debris wash onto beaches, but the issue doesn't stop there. Beach sand, moved by ocean currents, carries pollution far from its source, creating a widespread issue. Meaning, garbage travels far from where it was originally thrown away. Coastal areas become dumping grounds for this debris, harming the animals and plants that call these places home.
				</p>
				<p>This challenge affects everyone, from children playing on the shore to adults enjoying beach days. It's our daily responsibility to recognize and cherish the importance of caring for our ocean sand. Together, we can ensure clean beaches and healthy oceans for future generations.
				</p>
				<p><strong>SANDSMILE</strong> is a website designed to inspire and encourage users to become dedicated collectors of debris that invades ocean beaches. The site allows users to track their individual and collective impact on collected trash across various coastal geographies. By transforming the beach into places where sand smiles, users not only contribute to a cleaner environment but also gain financial benefits. Sandsmile acts to foster a community of socially responsible citizens and companies, turning beach cleanup into a rewarding and impactful endeavor.
